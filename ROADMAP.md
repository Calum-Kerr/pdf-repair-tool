## Notes
- Each task should follow the Power of 10 rules for safety-critical software
- All new features must include corresponding tests
- Security considerations should be implemented before adding new features
- Performance testing should be conducted after each major feature addition
- Regular security audits should be scheduled
- Resource usage should be continuously monitored
- Regular compliance audits should be scheduled
- Data retention policies should be reviewed quarterly
