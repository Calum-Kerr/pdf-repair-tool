# PDF Repair Tool Performance Guidelines

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- At least 1GB free disk space for temporary files
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Performance Recommendations

### File Size Guidelines

- Optimal file size: < 100MB
- Maximum supported file size: 500MB
- Files >100MB will use chunked processing
- Multiple files should total < 1GB for batch processing

### Batch Processing

- Optimal batch size: 10-20 files
- Maximum recommended batch: 50 files
- Allow 1-2 minutes processing time per 10MB of PDF data
- Monitor available disk space (need ~2x total batch size)

### Resource Usage

- Memory usage peaks at ~2x file size during repair
- CPU usage increases with file complexity
- Network bandwidth: ~1.2x file size upload/download
- Temporary storage: ~2x file size during processing

### Performance Tips

1. **File Preparation**
   - Remove unnecessary content before upload
   - Optimize images if possible
   - Split very large PDFs (>500MB) before upload

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Group similar-sized files together
   - Monitor system resources during large batches
   - Use the queue management interface for large jobs

3. **Network Considerations**
   - Use a stable internet connection
   - Allow for upload/download time in planning
   - Enable progress tracking for large transfers

4. **Browser Performance**
   - Clear browser cache regularly
   - Limit other resource-intensive tabs
   - Use latest browser version for best performance

## Monitoring and Alerts

The system includes built-in monitoring for:
- Memory usage (threshold: 85%)
- CPU usage (threshold: 80%)
- Queue size (limit: 100 jobs)
- Error rates (threshold: 5%)
- Processing times (threshold: 30 seconds)

### Alert Types

1. **Memory Alerts**
   - Warning at 85% usage
   - Critical at 95% usage
   - Action: Reduce batch size or pause new uploads

2. **CPU Alerts**
   - Warning at 80% sustained usage
   - Critical at 90% sustained usage
   - Action: Reduce concurrent processing

3. **Queue Alerts**
   - Warning at 80 queued jobs
   - Critical at 100 queued jobs
   - Action: Wait for queue to clear before adding more

4. **Error Rate Alerts**
   - Warning at 5% error rate
   - Critical at 10% error rate
   - Action: Check file integrity and formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Performance Issues

1. **Slow Processing**
   - Check file size and complexity
   - Monitor system resources
   - Reduce batch size if necessary
   - Ensure adequate free disk space

2. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce concurrent processing
   - Process large files individually
   - Clear browser cache
   - Close unnecessary applications

3. **Queue Bottlenecks**
   - Monitor queue size
   - Reduce batch submission rate
   - Check for failed jobs
   - Wait for queue clearance

4. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connection
   - Monitor upload/download speeds
   - Use wired connection if possible
   - Retry failed transfers

### Error Recovery

1. **File Corruption**
   - Verify source file integrity
   - Check for complete upload
   - Try processing in smaller chunks
   - Save repair reports for reference

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Clear temporary files
   - Restart browser
   - Reduce concurrent operations
   - Monitor system resources

3. **Batch Failures**
   - Check individual file status
   - Review error messages
   - Retry failed items separately
   - Adjust batch size if needed
